## License  

You do not have to include [the full license](LICENSE) in the code because it is too long. That's why Black Wolf made [this small text](#small-license-text) that has to stay in the code.  
If [that license](#small-license-text) can not be found in the code on this repository, you can do whatever you want with the code and I won't even care if you claim you made it. 

#### Small license text
